These French lyrics are quite complex and poetic, with rich imagery and deeper meanings. For an A1 level learner, let's focus on breaking down the simpler elements, including basic vocabulary, grammar concepts, and pronunciation.

### Vocabulary and Phrases

- **"Je ne crois pas"** (I do not believe) - **"croire"** is the verb meaning to believe. This phrase uses the negative structure **"ne...pas"** around the verb.
  - **Example:** "Je ne mange pas de viande." (I do not eat meat.)

- **"que nous ferons ce voyage"** (that we will make this trip) - **"faire"** (to make/do) is used in the future tense **"nous ferons"** (we will make). **"Voyage"** means trip or journey.
  - **Example:** "Nous ferons un gâteau." (We will make a cake.)

- **"Au delà de ces ciels lumineux"** (Beyond these luminous skies) - **"au delà de"** means beyond. **"Ciel"** (sky) is a masculine noun and **"lumineux"** is an adjective meaning luminous or bright.
  - **Example:** "Au-delà de la montagne." (Beyond the mountain.)

- **"inaccessibles à l’ombre"** (inaccessible to the shadow) - **"inaccessible"** means inaccessible. **"À l'ombre"** (to the shadow) shows a prepositional phrase describing the relationship with "ombre" (shadow).
  - **Example:** "Le jardin est inaccessible aux visiteurs." (The garden is inaccessible to visitors.)

- **"le corps se courbe"** (the body bends) - **"Corps"** (body) is a masculine noun, and **"se courbe"** is a reflexive verb form meaning bends itself.
  - **Example:** "Il se courbe pour ramasser le livre." (He bends down to pick up the book.)

- **"les marques du temps"** (the marks of time) - **"Marques"** means marks or signs, and **"temps"** means time. The phrase uses **"du"** (of the) as a partitive article.
  - **Example:** "Les effets du soleil." (The effects of the sun.)

### Grammar Concepts

- **Future Tense:** The lyrics use the future tense in **"nous ferons"** (we will make). In French, the future tense is used to talk about things that will happen.

- **Negative Structure:** The phrase **"Je ne crois pas"** demonstrates the basic negative structure in French, which typically surrounds the verb with **"ne"** and **"pas"**.

- **Reflexive Verbs:** In **"le corps se courbe"**, the reflexive verb **"se courbe"** (bends itself) is used. Reflexive verbs are common in French and show that the subject is performing the action on itself.

### Pronunciation Tips

- **"Je ne crois pas"** - [ʒə nə kʁwa pa] - Note the soft "j" sound, and the "oi" in "crois" sounds like "wa" in English. The final "s" in "crois" and "pas" is silent.

- **"que nous ferons ce voyage"** - [kə nu fəʁɔ̃ sə vwaˈjaʒ] - The "que" is pronounced like "kuh," and the "ons" in "ferons" is a nasal sound, similar to "own" in English but nasalized.

- **"Au delà de ces ciels lumineux"** - [o dəla də se sjɛl lymiˈnø] - "Au-delà" has a nasal "au," and "lumineux" ends with a soft "x" that sounds like "eux."

### Example for Practice

Let's create a simpler sentence inspired by the theme:

- **"Je regarde les étoiles au-delà des nuages."** (I look at the stars beyond the clouds.)
  - This sentence uses "regarder" (to look at), "les étoiles" (the stars), and "au-delà" (beyond) to form a sentence that captures a similar sense of looking beyond what is immediately visible.

These lyrics provide a rich opportunity to explore complex themes while practicing basic French language structures and enriching vocabulary.
