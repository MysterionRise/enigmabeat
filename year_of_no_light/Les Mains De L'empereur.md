### Grammar (La grammaire)

1. **Reflexive Verbs (Les verbes réfléchis)**: "Les enfants baignent dans la lumière." Here, "baignent" could be seen as part of a reflexive verb structure in a different context (se baigner - to bathe oneself). In this case, it's used to describe an action being done in a general sense (the children bathe in the light).

2. **Metaphors (Les métaphores)**: The use of metaphors is common in French poetry and songs. "Nous sommes ses phares" (We are its lighthouses) metaphorically means guiding lights or sources of inspiration.

3. **Possessive Adjectives (Les adjectifs possessifs)**: "Nous sommes ses forces" (We are its strengths). "Ses" is a possessive adjective meaning "its" in English, showing ownership or belonging.

### Pronunciation Tips (Conseils de prononciation)

- **Cèdent**: The "cè" sounds like "sè", with the "è" pronounced like the "e" in "bed". The "d" at the end is silent: "sèd".
- **Baignent**: "Bai" sounds like "bay", and the "gn" has a soft nasal sound similar to "ny" in "canyon": "bayñ".
- **Étoffe**: The "é" is pronounced like the "ay" in "say", and the final "e" is silent: "ay-toff".

### Simple Sentences (Phrases simples)
