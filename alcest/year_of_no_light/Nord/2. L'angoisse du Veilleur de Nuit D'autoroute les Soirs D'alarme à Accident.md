These French song lyrics, while containing some complex imagery, can be broken down into simpler language concepts suitable for learners at an A1 level. We'll focus on basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

### Vocabulary and Phrases

- **"Eteints, tous feux éteints"** (Extinguished, all lights extinguished) - **"Eteints"** is the past participle of **"éteindre"** (to extinguish or turn off), and **"feux"** means lights or fires. This phrase emphasizes the action of extinguishing lights.
  - **Example:** "La lumière est éteinte." (The light is turned off.)

- **"Ne te retourne pas"** (Do not turn around) - This is a negative imperative sentence. **"Ne...pas"** surrounds the verb **"te retourner"** (to turn yourself), forming a command not to do something.
  - **Example:** "Ne regarde pas en arrière." (Do not look back.)

- **"Rien ne viendra"** (Nothing will come) - **"Rien"** means nothing, and **"viendra"** is the future tense of **"venir"** (to come). This phrase suggests that nothing will happen in the future.
  - **Example:** "Rien ne changera." (Nothing will change.)

- **"Au fin fond d'une sans phare"** (In the very depths of one without a lighthouse) - **"fin fond"** refers to the very depths or end, and **"sans phare"** means without a lighthouse.
  - **Example:** "Au fond de la mer." (At the bottom of the sea.)

- **"Dans les bas-fonds d'une nuit sans fin"** (In the depths of an endless night) - **"bas-fonds"** means depths or lower parts, and **"nuit sans fin"** means endless night.
  - **Example:** "Dans l'obscurité d'une longue nuit." (In the darkness of a long night.)

- **"Un cadavre pour co-pilote"** (A corpse for a co-pilot) - **"cadavre"** means corpse, and **"co-pilote"** means co-pilot. This phrase uses a metaphor to describe the companion in a grim scenario.
  - **Example:** "Un ami pour compagnon." (A friend for a companion.)

### Grammar Concepts

- **Past Participle:** The word **"Eteints"** is a past participle used as an adjective. Past participles in French can be used to describe a state resulting from an action.

- **Negative Imperative:** **"Ne te retourne pas"** demonstrates the negative command form. In French, commands can be formed in the negative by placing **"ne...pas"** around the verb.

- **Future Tense:** **"Rien ne viendra"** uses the future tense, **"viendra,"** to talk about what will not happen in the future.

### Pronunciation Tips

- **"Eteints, tous feux éteints"** - [etɛ̃, tu fø etɛ̃] - The "in" in "éteints" is a nasal sound, and the "s" in "feux" is silent.

- **"Ne te retourne pas"** - [nə tə ʁətuʁn pa] - The "e" in "te" and "ne" is a schwa sound, like the "e" in "the." The "r" in "retourne" is softly rolled.

- **"Dans les bas-fonds d'une nuit sans fin"** - [dɑ̃ le ba fɔ̃ dyn nɥi sɑ̃ fɛ̃] - "Dans" has a nasal "an," and "nuit" has a unique "ui" sound, like "wee."

### Example for Practice

Inspired by the lyrics, we can create a simpler sentence:

- **"Je marche dans l'obscurité de la nuit."** (I walk in the darkness of the night.)
  - This sentence uses "marcher" (to walk) and "obscurité" (darkness), drawing from the imagery of the song.

Through these lyrics, learners can explore the poetic aspects of the French language while practicing basic grammar and vocabulary.
